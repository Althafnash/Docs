This command provides insight into how the HTTP.SYS driver, which handles HTTP requests for applications like IIS, is configured regarding its caching behavior.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show cachestate &gt; http_cachestate.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The command netsh http show cachestate is used to display information about the HTTP response cache in Windows. This cache is managed by the HTTP.sys kernel-mode driver and stores responses for faster delivery to clients.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show iplisten &gt; http_iplisten.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The command netsh http show iplisten is used in Windows to display the IP addresses in the HTTP service's IP listen list. This list defines the specific IP addresses on which the HTTP service (which handles HTTP traffic for applications like IIS) will bind and listen for incoming connections.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show servicestate &gt; http_servicestate.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh http show servicestate command in Windows provides a snapshot of the HTTP service, specifically detailing the registered URL namespaces and associated server sessions and request queues managed by HTTP.SYS. This command is useful for understanding which applications or services are listening on specific HTTP/HTTPS ports and URLs.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show setting &gt; http_setting.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh http show setting command is not a complete command within the netsh http context. To view specific HTTP settings, you need to specify which setting you want to display. The netsh http context provides several show sub-commands to display different aspects of the HTTP service configuration.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show sslcert &gt; http_sslcert.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The command netsh http show sslcert is used in Windows to display the SSL certificate bindings configured for the HTTP Service. This command provides a list of all SSL server certificate bindings and their corresponding client certificate policies for specific IP addresses and ports.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show timeout &gt; http_timeout.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh http show timeout command is used in Windows to display the current timeout values configured for the HTTP Server API (HTTP.sys). This API is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses at a low level in the operating system.</p> <pre><code>netsh http show urlacl  &gt;  http_urlacl.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh http show urlacl command displays the Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) for reserved URLs on a Windows system. These URL reservations are managed by the HTTP Server API (HTTP.sys), which allows non-administrator users or services to register and listen on specific URLs.</p>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/IPV4/","title":"IPV4","text":"<p>These sets of commands help to gather information about Internet protocol 4 of the Target machine</p>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/IPV4/#synopsis","title":"SYNOPSIS","text":"<ul> <li>Collects various IPv4 configuration and status information using netsh commands.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/IPV4/#description","title":"DESCRIPTION","text":"<ul> <li> <p>This script collects various IPv4 configuration and status information using the netsh command</p> </li> <li> <p>The show address show the current IP address configuration for all interfaces.</p> </li> <li> <p>The show offload displays the offload settings for IPv4.</p> </li> <li> <p>The show dynamicportrange shows the dynamic port range settings for IPv4.</p> </li> <li> <p>The show interface displays the current IPv4 interface configuration.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/IPV4/#why-it-is-used","title":"WHY IT IS USED","text":"<ul> <li>This script is intended for use in a controlled environment and should be executed with appropriate permissions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/IPV4/#code-overview","title":"Code Overview","text":"<pre><code>@echo off\nmkdir IPV4\ncd IPV4\n</code></pre> <p>Create a new folder name IPV4</p> <pre><code>netsh interface ipv4 show address &gt; IPV4_address.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh interface ipv4 show address command in Windows Command Prompt displays the IPv4 address configuration for all network interfaces on the system.</p> <pre><code>netsh interface ipv4 show offload &gt; IPV4_offload.txt\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh interface ipv4 show offload command is not the correct syntax; instead, use netsh int tcp show global or netsh int tcp show chimneystats to view TCP Chimney Offload status, and check the network adapter's advanced settings for other offload features like IPv4 checksum and Receive-Side Scaling (RSS).

The user likely intended to type a command to view or modify network interface settings. Common commands include netsh interface ipv4 show interfaces to show a list of IPv4 network interfaces, or netsh interface ipv4 show address to display IPv4 address information for all interfaces. </p> <pre><code>netsh interface ipv4 show config\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh interface ipv4 show config command, when executed in the Windows Command Prompt, displays the IPv4 configuration information for all network interfaces on the system.</p> <pre><code>netsh interface ipv4 show destinationcache\n</code></pre> <p>The command netsh interface ipv4 show destinationcache is a Windows command-line utility used to display the contents of the IPv4 destination cache on a system. This cache stores information about recently accessed network destinations, including details learned through Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD).</p> <pre><code>netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange\n</code></pre> <p>The netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange command is used in Windows to display the ranges of TCP and UDP ports that are currently excluded from use by applications. This exclusion can be due to various reasons, such as system services reserving ports, Hyper-V or other virtualization technologies, or manually configured exclusions.</p> <pre><code>netsh interface ipv4 show global\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show icmpstats\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show interfaces\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show ipaddresses\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show ipnettomediaj\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show ipstats\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show joins\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show neighbors\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show route\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show tcpconnections\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show udpconnections\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show show udpstats\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show udpstats\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show winsservers\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp\n\nnetsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=udp\n\nnotepad IPV4.txt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/NASH_NETWORK_TOOL/","title":"NASH_NETWORK_TOOL","text":"<p>This tools helps the suers to gather network information of the traget device</p>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/NASH_NETWORK_TOOL/#synopsis","title":"SYNOPSIS","text":"<ul> <li>This batch file creates a new project folder structure for the NASH NETWORK TOOL (NNT) and copies the necessary script files into the newly created folders.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"WindowsSocureFiles/NASH_NETWORK_TOOL/#description","title":"DESCRIPTION","text":"<ul> <li>The script prompts the user to enter a folder name, creates the main project folder, and subfolders for different network tools.
